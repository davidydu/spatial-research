# Spatial — shared project handoff

Start here in Codex, Claude Code or any other harness. This file preserves the
project context previously carried in chat and private agent memory. Existing
decisions, plans and evidence remain in their owning documents; this is the map
and restart route. No private memory service, old agent session or temporary
directory is required.

## Read only what the next task needs

1. Read [[workflow]] and [[80 - Initial Compiler Goal]] for the current route.
2. For compiler work, read `AGENTS.md` and `PROJECT_STATE.md` on the implementation
   branch, then its active plan and the relevant checkpoint design/evidence.
3. For research, start at [[00 - Python Rewrite Index]] and the relevant study;
   keep decisions in the existing D-number register.
4. For presentation work, read [[05 - Python Professor Brief]],
   [[2026-10-01-python-professor-presentation-outline]] and
   [[70 - Engineering Architecture Map]]. Verify progress against current
   compiler evidence before updating slides.

## Repository map

Local paths below describe the current machine. Use repository URLs and branches
on another machine; do not make another harness depend on these absolute paths.

| Responsibility | Repository / branch | Local checkout |
|---|---|---|
| Research, decisions, specifications, progress | [spatial-research](https://github.com/davidydu/spatial-research), `main` | `/Users/david/Documents/Spatial Research` |
| Python compiler and test evidence | [spatial-py](https://github.com/davidydu/spatial-py/tree/work/initial-reference), `work/initial-reference` | `/Users/david/Documents/David_code/spatial-py/.worktrees/initial-reference` |
| Documentation build and presentation UI | [spatial-research-site](https://github.com/davidydu/spatial-research-site), `main` | `/Users/david/Documents/spatial-research-site` |
| Original Scala source evidence | Local reference clone; see [[reference-clones]] | `/Users/david/Documents/David_code/spatial` |

**Checkout trap:** the outer `David_code/spatial-py` directory is bootstrap
`main`, not the working compiler. Inspect Git status, branch and worktree list
before edits. Use the existing implementation worktree, or check out
`work/initial-reference` on a new machine. Do not merge or restart the compiler
just because the bootstrap checkout has little code. Earlier `spatial-rs` work
and Rust presentations are historical evidence.

## Decisions and user preferences from the conversation

- The professor requested a pure Python rewrite: first explain what Python
  Spatial looks like, then lower it toward HLS. HLS is the agreed eventual
  target; the current reference milestone does not require vendor tools.
- Assume a capable team and capable coding agents. Earlier Rust arguments based
  on maintenance skill or type safety are not grounds to reopen that direction.
- David authorized the initial implementation on 4 October. [[D-27]] owns the
  direction; [[D-28]] and the implementation blueprints describe the detailed
  proposal. User authorization is separate from professor approval of every
  architectural detail. No new implementation approval question was pending at
  the D3d checkpoint.
- Research and compare designs before implementation. Implement general rules
  and unfamiliar compositions. A cherry-picked lab example or fixture-specific
  compiler path is not acceptance.
- Use agents for bounded parallel work to control time and cost. The integrating
  agent personally reviews their work. Codex agents are preferred; later user
  messages also authorize Claude Opus 5.5 through `claude2 -p`, with the approved
  account checked locally. Opus supersedes the earlier Fable preference. A
  harness without those tools may use equivalent independent review roles.
- Read local files and use command-line checks by default. Use browser UI when
  visual or interactive inspection is necessary. Preserve coherent Git
  checkpoints under `davidydu`; update research documentation with results.
- Professor-facing material should lead with the big picture, concrete progress
  and links. The main talk is about ten minutes. Explain what Python Spatial is,
  why the plan is feasible, implementation steps and next evidence. The professor
  already knows Spatial; avoid long program walkthroughs or re-arguing HLS.
- Use plain, verbal scripts and explanatory slide text. The requested visual
  direction is restrained, inspired by Thinking Machines Lab. The Excalidraw map
  should support both overview and detail; render and inspect visual changes.
  Interactive illustrations are not executions of the compiler.

## Current checkpoint and next task

At the last behavior checkpoint, `spatial-py@c27f6f1` implemented D3d authored
requirement admission. `4fe9baf` records publication closeout. The 11 October
verification passed **520 source tests and 520 installed-wheel tests** on
CPython 3.14.5, with independent specification/case review and parent code review.
The research snapshot was `e05aa0c`; its deployment was
[38183442280](https://github.com/davidydu/spatial-research-site/actions/runs/38183442280).
These are dated results; this handoff does not claim another compiler test run.

The compiler's tracked
[PROJECT_STATE.md](https://github.com/davidydu/spatial-py/blob/work/initial-reference/PROJECT_STATE.md)
owns the detailed restart state, reproducible verification commands and semantic
pitfalls. Its support ledger and `docs/evidence/` own implementation evidence.
[[80 - Initial Compiler Goal]] is the published big-picture status. Prefer these
current records over old chat replies, diagrams or slide test counts.

D3d checks request ownership, local typed subjects and activation references.
It retains semantic truth, requested placement and existing guard correctness
as pending. Supplied claims cannot weaken compiler-derived requirements. The
next task is to design a **closed canonical representation of general guard
demands**, then validate authored semantics, insert ordered checks and recheck
the combined obligation ledger. That representation is not already implemented.

The full verifier/publication, source lowering, host preparation and reference
execution remain unfinished. The planned Lab 1 tiled-scale example and its
tail/helper/branch companion are specified in compiler `docs/lab1-demo-target.md`;
they have not run through a complete compiler. Preserve the separate final
unfamiliar-composition, artifact-agreement and verified-editing gates.

## Documentation and presentation delivery

The [research site](https://davidydu.github.io/spatial-research-site/) builds from
this vault. The current [Python presentation](https://davidydu.github.io/spatial-research-site/presentation/python/)
lives in the site's `presentation/python/` directory. The deck at `/presentation/`
is the historical Rust-era proposal. The editable diagram and original exports
live under `50 - Python Rewrite/30 - Implementation Design/assets/`; the site
has presentation copies. Keep copies consistent when changing the map.

From the site repository, build against the actual research checkout:

```sh
npm run build:site -- --directory '/Users/david/Documents/Spatial Research'
```

Use the Node/npm versions in the site `package.json`; install dependencies with
`npm ci` when needed. Follow the site README for previews and the publication
workflow. A docs-only Quartz rebuild can remove the presentation from generated
`public/`; `build:site` restores the combined output. Never edit generated output
or a build-time `content/` clone as the source of truth.

Publish in order: implementation checkpoint, research notes, then the site.
Research pushes alone do not immediately deploy the separate site. After the
research push completes, push site changes or dispatch its existing workflow:

```sh
gh workflow run deploy.yml --repo davidydu/spatial-research-site --ref main
```

Use the returned run URL/ID, or locate the newly dispatched run with `gh run list`
and verify its branch/commit, then wait for completion. Check changed live pages
for HTTP 200 and new content markers. A successful build or an old deployed page is
not proof that local changes were published. Validate internal links and anchors;
for presentation changes also inspect layouts, navigation, notes and map controls.

## Keep this context shared

Before ending a checkpoint, record the decision, correction, test evidence,
remaining gates, exact next task and any blocker in the owning tracked files.
Update compiler `PROJECT_STATE.md` for implementation state; update this map for
cross-project workflow/preferences; append dated results to [[progress-log]].
Keep `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` as short entry pointers instead of parallel memory
stores. Preserve earlier evidence and mark stale resume documents as historical.

Temporary probe logs and old agent sessions may help an investigation, but
required expectations belong in tracked tests/evidence. Do not copy credentials,
unrelated personal memory or raw private transcripts into these repositories.
Model-specific skills are optional: planning, independent review, meaningful
red/green checks and verification can all be performed from these shared files.
